# Weather-forecasting-with-Regression-models

This is a presentation on weather forecasting using Linear regression models. More specifically, I am analyzing the Earth's average surface temperature, going back 150 years
and using this data to determine where temperatures are headed in the future. The data source was from Kaggle, which in return pulled the data from Berkely. There is a coding file, 
a presentation in powerpoint, a pdf of the code file and a whitepaper in this repository.
